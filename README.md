##Sidebar Toggle with Outside Click Detection
This project demonstrates a simple sidebar that can be toggled open and closed using JavaScript.

🔧 Features:
Open/Close Sidebar using toggle buttons.

Click Outside to Close: The sidebar closes automatically when the user clicks anywhere outside of it.



🧠 Key JavaScript Concepts Used:
DOM manipulation (getElementById, querySelector)

Event listeners (click)

event.stopPropagation() to prevent unintended closing when clicking inside the sidebar.

📁 Files:
index.html: Contains basic layout structure.

style.css: (Optional) For styling sidebar and layout.

script.js: Main JavaScript logic for sidebar behavior.
